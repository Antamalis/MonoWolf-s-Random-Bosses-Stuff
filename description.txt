This is my first mod ever. I'll just be adding stuff at random as I learn how to create mods.

My main focus of this mod is bosses, cuz who doesn't like them, right? But, there is a lot I need to learn before I actually manage to create one, so just sit tight.

I'll try to keep the forum post updated as I add stuff in case anyone actually want to try this mod out (which I would appreciate).

Just a quick note:
	 I have NEVER created a single sprite prior to this mod, so yeah...
	 Don't expect regular updates.
	 Don't expect things to be balanced.
	 Feedback/ideas are appreciated, but no guarantees that they will be fulfilled.
Anyway, here's the stuff this mod adds so far:
	 2 Weapons
	 1 Material
